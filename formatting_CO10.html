		<h3>This is about some of my favorite flavors</h3>

		<main>
		
		<p>My first flavor is strawberry</p>
		
		<!--I organized it in lists because I liked how it looked-->
		
		<ul>
		
			<li>I like this flavor a lot and I get it from the market all the time</li>
			
			</ul>
			
		<p>Another flavor that I like is half baked by Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream</p>
		
		<ul>
		
			<li>It is vanilla and chocolate swirled ice cream with cookie dough bits and brownie chunks in it</li>
			
			<li>It is really good because I like cookie dough and brownies and when you mix this all up with ice cream it taste even better</li>
			
			</ul>
			
		<p>My Last favorite flavor is something called "All Nighter"<p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>I get this ice cream from UD's Creamery. It is one of their custom flavors that the food science major students have created</li>
			
			<li>It is coffee ice cream with cookie dough, chocolate fudge and toffee mixed in</li> 
			
			<li>This is such a good flavor and they also have lots of unique flavors at their creamery</li>
			
			</ul>
